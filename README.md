- Run compiled programs directly in Hatari emulator
- Integrated error and warning messages in VSCode's Problems panel
- Quick commands for compilation and execution

## Requirements

Before using this extension, ensure you have:

1. VBCC compiler installed and configured with Atari ST (68k) backend
2. The `vc` frontend command available in your PATH
3. Hatari emulator installed and available in your PATH

## Usage

### Compiling C Files

2. Use one of these methods to compile:
   - Press `F1` and type "VBCC: Compile Current File"
   - Use the keyboard shortcut (if configured)
   - Right-click in the editor and select "VBCC: Compile Current File"
